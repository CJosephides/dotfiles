    # RNB, A VIM COLORSCHEME TEMPLATE

    # This template is designed to help vimmers create their own colorschemes
    # without much effort.
    #
    # You will need Ruby to generate your colorscheme but Ruby knowledge is
    # not needed at all.
    #
    # The process is divided in four steps:
    #   1. start by editing your colorscheme's information,
    #   2. define your colors,
    #   3. define your highlight groups and links,
    #   4. and generate your colorscheme.

    # Step 1: information
    #
    # Make sure the name of your colorscheme is unique and attractive.
    # The description should fit in a single line with no linefeed.
    # 'background' can be "light" or "dark".
    information = {
        author:      "Christos Josephides",
        email:       "cjosephides@gmail.com",
        name:        "ristretto",
        description: "Light theme..",
        background:  "light",
        webpage:     ""
    }

    # Step 2: colors
    #
    # black = [       give each color a distinctive name
    #   "#000000",    hexadecimal color for GVim/MacVim and "true colors" terminals
    #   0,            integer between 0 and 255 for terminals supporting 256 colors
    #   "black"       color name for less capable color terminals, can be "darkred", "red",
    #                 "darkgreen", "green", "darkyellow", "yellow", "darkblue", "blue",
    #                 "darkmagenta", "magenta", "black", "darkgrey", "grey", "white"
    # ]
    #
    # If your colors are defined correctly, the resulting colorscheme is guaranteed
    # to work in GVim (Windows/Linux), MacVim, and any properly set up terminal emulator.
    #
    # The colors below are the first 16 colors of the xterm palette. They
    # are only here as an example so you can get rid of them, I won't be mad.
    black       = ["#000000", 0, "bw0"]
    darkred     = ["#242424", 1, "bw1"]
    darkgreen   = ["#484848", 2, "bw2"]
    darkyellow  = ["#6c6c6c", 3, "bw3"]
    darkblue    = ["#909090", 4, "bw4"]
    darkmagenta = ["#b4b4b4", 5, "bw5"]
    darkcyan    = ["#d8d8d8", 6, "bw6"]
    gray        = ["#fcfcfc", 7, "bw7"]

    darkgray    = ["#c82829", 8, "red"]
    red         = ["#f5871f", 9, "orange"]
    green       = ["#eab700", 10, "yellow"]
    yellow      = ["#718c00", 11, "green"]
    blue        = ["#3e999f", 12, "cyan"]
    magenta     = ["#4271ae", 13, "blue"]
    cyan        = ["#8959a8", 14, "magenta"]
    white       = ["#a3685a", 15, "brown"]

    # Step 3: highlights
    #
    # You can define highlight groups like this:
    #
    #   [ "Normal",       name of the highlight group
    #     white,          the color used for background color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     darkgray,       the color used for foreground color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     "NONE"          style, can be "bold", "underline", "reverse", "italic",
    #                     "standout", "NONE" or "undercurl"
    #   ]
    #
    # The sample above tells Vim to render normal text in dark gray against a white
    # background, without any styling.
    #
    # or link an highlight group to another:
    #
    #   [ "Title", "Normal" ]
    #
    # In GUI Vim, there is an additional color for the undercurl used to
    # highlight spelling mistakes:
    #
    #   [ "SpellBad",     name of the highlight group
    #     "NONE",         the color used for background color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     red,            the color used for foreground color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     "undercurl",    style
    #     red             color used for the undercurl
    #   ]
    #
    # The sample above tells Vim to render badly spelled words in red against the current
    # background, with a red undercurl.
    #
    # You can add any custom highlight group to the standard list below but you shouldn't
    # remove any if you want a working colorscheme.
    highlights = [
        [ "Normal", bw7, bw1, "NONE" ],
        [ "NonText", bw7, bw4, "NONE" ],
        [ "Comment", bw7, bw4, "NONE" ],

    # A few general advices:
    #
    #   * The Windows console is limited to the 16 so-called "ANSI" colors but it has
    #     a few of them interverted which makes numbers impractical. Use color names
    #     instead of numbers: :help cterm-colors
    #   * The Windows console (yeahâ€¦) doesn't do italics, underlines or bolded text;
    #     it is limited to normal and reverse. Keep that in mind if you want
    #     your colorscheme to be usable in as many environments as possible by as many
    #     people as possible.
    #   * All of the terminal emulators in use these days allow their users to
    #     change the 16 so-called "ANSI" colors. It is also possible on some platforms
    #     to change some or all of the 256 colors in the xterm palette. Don't take
    #     anything for granted.
    #   * When used against a light background, strong colors work better than muted
    #     ones. Light or dark doesn't really matters. Also, it is harder to discriminate
    #     between two similar colors on a light background.
    #   * Both strong and muted colors work well against a dark background. It is also
    #     easier to work with similar colors, but dark colors don't work at all.
    #   * Use as many text samples as possible. String-heavy languages may look completely
    #     different than keyword-heavy ones. This can have an impact on the usability
    #     of your colorscheme.
    #   * Most terminal emulators and terminal multiplexers currently in use on unix-like
    #     systems support 256 colors but they almost always default to a '$TERM' that tells
    #     Vim otherwise. Your users will need to make sure their terminal emulator/multiplexer
    #     is correctly set up if they want to enjoy the best possible experience.
